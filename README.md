## Description

**React-JS** front-end. **Sass**, **Bootstrap**, and **framer motion** for styling. 

**Git** was used to handle version control throughout development.

## Installation

To get setup, download this code, and then run the following commands in the root directory of the app:

    npm install
    npm start

This should start the app, and we can see it by going to http://localhost:3000 in the browser.
 

## Future work
I am planning to keep this portfolio updated as I get more experience.
